# To-Good-Co
This repository contains a simple and interactive analog clock built using [HTML/CSS/JavaScript] (or specify your tech stack, e.g., Python, JavaFX, etc.). The clock dynamically displays the current time using smoothly animated hour, minute, and second hands, mimicking the appearance and behavior of a traditional analog clock.
